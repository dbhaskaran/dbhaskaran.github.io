I"<p>Hello world!</p>

<p>To this end, we develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. We want to be able to build the perfect instruments to answer the  scientific questions we deem most important (see <a href="research">Research</a>).</p>

<p>We are located at Leiden University, the birthplace of superconductivity and home to Kamerlingh Onnes, Lorentz, Huygens, Einstein, de Sitter, and others (see e.g. <a href="https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/history/colloquium/muur_heel.html">the wall of signatures from Ehrenfest lecturers</a>). We exchange ideas and work with our neighbors from <a href="http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl/qo-home">Quantum Matter &amp; Optics</a>, as well as with the colleagues from our <a href="https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl">world-class theory section</a>.</p>
